Top Down Spaceshooter
This game took about a week to build to get an alpha version ready
In this version of the game when ran you have to survive meteors 

controls 
- arrow key for up,down,left,right movements 
- spacebar to shoot projectiles 

What's being added next?
- adding a wave system so that as the player continues to survive 
  in the game it becomes more diffcult to dodge the meteors (Completed)

- Right now there is nothing stopping the player from leaving the game screen
  and going outside of the windows boarders or going over the HUD interface 
  where the Lives and score is. So going to implement a border so that player cannot 
  leave the screen of be over the HUD. (Completed)

- Adding more meteors adding more difficulty to the game by adding different types
  of meteors bigger and smaller sizes to where the bigger the meteor the more bullets it 
  takes to destroy. (Completed)

- Adding Win and Lose Conditions (Completed)

- having player respawn after dying instead of game exiting game (Completed)

- added scrolling background (Completed)

- Optional - this is only if I feel like its needed a power upgrade system where there
  will be 3 levels of upgrades for the bullets or 2 types of bullets and both has 3 levels
  of upgrades, but will depend on how many waves I add or if I decide to added more levels (Completed)

- Optional - adding a splash screen and main menu (Completed)

- Doing final touch ups on game will add final gameplay video of game in future release
